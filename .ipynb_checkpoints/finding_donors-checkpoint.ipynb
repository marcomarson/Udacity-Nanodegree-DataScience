    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "# First Model  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "Support Vector Machines are really good in a range of real world problem, It was used way more often until a few years ago. A good application would be text categorization, or image classification. Even though it performs a little bit worse than the neural networks state of art.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "A good strength would be that it uses the kernel trick, and find the optimal boundary between the data. It performs well when the data is not categorical, and when it has a lot of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "Support Vector Machines struggle when there are more features than observations, and when there are overlapping points, because the SVM will not be able to draw a hyperplane without mysclassifying. ANd it is a computational heavy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "WE have 36k observations in the training set, and 100k features to extract information from. After changing all categorical data (We did in the preprocessing), SVM will probably perform well in this data because we one-hot encoded all categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Second Model - Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "I would say every problem that it can answer with a yes/no or any dichtomous variable, it can be used logistic regression. For example :Do body weight, calorie intake, fat intake, and age have an influence on the probability of having a heart attack ? (yes or no).\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "Logistic Regression is robust and really fast and less prone to over-fitting as others algorithms. It usually is very good with small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "It suffers from multicollinearity as the others regressions, it cant be used for multi class classifications problem. As the support vector machine, all categorical features should be one hot encoded as well, because it can worse the model. And it does not perform better than others algorithms as we go increasing the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "It makes me thing that logistic regression might perform well because of the number of observations, and we hot encoded all categorical features as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Third Model - Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "A lot of applications as well. The Website Towards DataScience shows a lot of applications in different fields as: Banking, Stock Market, Medicine and E-Commerce. Example: Detect customers who will use the bank's service more frenquently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "Less Prone to overfitting, by using more trees, it lowers the rist of overfitting. And by using more trees, it reduces the change to stumble across a tree that does not perform well. It usually performs well where there are no strong linear relationship between feature and target.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "It suffers a few limitations like as we go increasing the numbers of trees, it makes the algorithm slow and ineffective. and it performs poorly when there are a strong linear relationship between feature and target.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "Random Forests are usually a way to try to understand a little bit more from the data presented. Then, even if RF does not performs well, we can use it's method feature importance to understand better our data\n",

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "First We need to understand what Regression is, and why it is improtant to understand it before logistic regression.\n",
    "Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables).\n",
    "Simple logistic regression is analogous to linear regression, except that the dependent variable is nominal instead of scalar in linear regression. Usually, the goal is to see whether the probability of getting a particular value of the nominal variable is associated with the measurement variable; the other goal is to predict the probability of getting a particular value of the nominal variable, given the measurement variable.\n",

    "We can see the plots above a linear regression and a logistic regression.The intuition behind logistic regression is to transform the output of a linear regression to a range of (0,1) in which the probability lies. So, if for a person we are trying to find if he likes apple or mango, Linear regression will give an output like A or B (A: person likes Apple, B: person likes Mango) while logistic regression will output probabilities for both the A and B. So, if (Probability)A > Probability(B), the person likes Apple.\n",
    "Now as we understood what Logistic regression is and what it does, let us try to understand how our logistic Regression Model works. Our purpose is to classify a person as earning more than 50k or earning less than 50k. For our task, we have some data which has certain features like Age, Education Level, Hours per Week. Where we already know that a few features has more importance in the model as others, like Age and Hours per week. So, from basic understanding we would say that a person having higher education who works more hours per week would/could earn more. And someone with same education working same hours, but younger will earn less because he has less work experience. Our model also works the same way, but with huge no of features and huge population of data. It analyzes all the features and figures our relationship between the features. It finds out which features greatly impacts a person’s earning and which does not. So, after the model is done with figuring out the training data, it defines a boundary(a curve between zero and one). This process is called training the Model. After training we are ready to predict if a person earns > 50 k or not. In this process, the model will input the data features to the already trained model and output probabilities belonging to each group. The person will belong to the class whose probability is greater.\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",
    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list, the following implementation may take some time to run!"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
